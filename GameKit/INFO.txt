Very Important:

	Do NOT remove any missing references on assemblies.

	TextMeshPro is required for GameKit\Bundles and GameKit\Core.



Understanding the folder structure:

	GameKit/Dependencies must always be imported.

	Core is the modular form of features. Core files can be customized through implementation and inheritance.

	Bundles are prebuilt systems which rely on Core files. Core files will not change regularly, but bundles can
	as they receive new features. If modifying a bundle it's encouraged to make a copy, and modify your copy. Each bundle
	is separate from another, but you will need to include Bundles/Dependencies if using any Bundle.

	If you know what features you are wanting specifically you can skip importing certain areas of the Core. If not,
	importing all Core files is recommended.



When using GameKit always import the following folders:

	Dependencies
